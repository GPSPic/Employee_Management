<!-- templates/manager/index.html -->
when editing manager in manager/edit.html, the order of managers in index.html changes?
partially solved by ordering the for loop in jinja

<!-- templates/employee/edit.html -->
text area formatting when text returns line?

<!-- delete manager route -->
can delete manager if employee assigned to them with ON DELETE CASCADE but deletes dependent employees
cannot update employee.manager to NULL
